To see all nodes:
    pbsnodes
To check out on which node a job is running, how much memory it has, etc.
    checkjob -v [JOB_ID]
To run an interactive job (like running on your own computer), the jobname becomes STDIN:
    qsub -l nodes=X:ppn=Y -I
To run jobs on specific nodes:
    -l nodes=[NODE_NAME]:ppn=Y + [NODE_NAME2]:ppn=Y2
To show the queue:
    showq
