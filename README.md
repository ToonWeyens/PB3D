Peeling Ballooning in 3D

Doctoral work by Toon Weyens
Universidad Carlos III de Madrid
2012-2016

To set up:
1. git clone https://ToonWeyens@bitbucket.org/ToonWeyens/pb3d.git
2. change PB3D_DIR in the makefile
3. copy or add symbolic links to the output files (e.g. wout_cdxu or cbm18a)

CHANGELOG

0.71: - Added MPI support for yes_no
      - First steps to do away with module test. From now on test will be done within the program at runtime.
      - Improved greatly the run script. Now -d and -s can be used to run Valgrind debugging and optionally also error source tracking.
      - Extended calc_eqd_grid to handle 3D cases and implemented this throughout.
      - Fixed a bug in calc_ang_grid when using toroidal flux: zeta should be the 2nd index, not the first.
      - Moved extend_grid to grid_ops.
      - Implemented trim_grid, which trims the ghost regions of a grid.
      - Resorted to using trim_grid and ext_grid in many of the routines where plots are made.
